## 🧠 Features

### ✅ Pomodoro Timer
- 25-minute focus sessions.
- Short break: 5 minutes.
- Long break: 15 minutes (every 4th break is automatically a long break).
- Optional **auto-transition** between study and break modes via settings.

### ⚙️ Customizable Timer Settings
- Adjust durations for study, short break, and long break sessions.
- Toggle auto-start for next session.

### 📝 Task List
Track your goals and session to-dos right inside the app. Stay aligned with your objectives during each Pomodoro session.

### 🚧 Distraction List
Don’t lose momentum when a distraction pops up.

> Example: You’re studying and suddenly remember an email you wanted to respond to. Instead of switching tabs and breaking your focus, just log "Reply to professor’s email" in the distraction list. Revisit it during your next break.

This lets you stay mindful and return to those distractions *on your terms*.

### 🌄 Custom Backgrounds
Choose from a set of visually appealing animated backgrounds to match your mood and style.

### 🎶 Background Music + Volume Control
Pick relaxing focus music to play in the background and adjust the volume to your preference. Music helps create an ambient study atmosphere.
